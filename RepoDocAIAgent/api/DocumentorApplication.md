## Class Overview
The `repodocaiagentApplication` class serves as the main entry point for the Java Documentation AI Agent. This application is designed to autonomously generate high-quality documentation for Java repositories by leveraging LangChain4J and Azure OpenAI services. It orchestrates the entire process, including repository cloning, Java file parsing, and documentation generation.

This class is a standalone utility with no inheritance or implemented interfaces. It is designed to be executed as a command-line application.

## Field Documentation

### `private static final Logger logger`
- **Type**: `org.slf4j.Logger`
- **Description**: A logger instance used for logging informational, warning, and error messages throughout the application's lifecycle.
- **Usage**: This field is used internally to log messages at various stages of the application's execution.

## Method Documentation

### `public static void main(String[] args)`
- **Description**: The main entry point for the application. This method initializes the application, validates input arguments, and orchestrates the documentation generation process for a specified GitHub repository.
- **Parameters**:
  - `String[] args`: Command-line arguments. The first argument is expected to be the GitHub repository URL.
- **Return Value**: `void`
- **Exceptions**:
  - The method terminates the application with `System.exit(1)` in case of invalid input or unhandled exceptions.
- **Usage Example**:
  ```java
  // Run the application with a GitHub repository URL as an argument
  String[] args = {"https://github.com/username/repo.git"};
  repodocaiagentApplication.main(args);
  ```
- **Details**:
  - Validates the presence of a GitHub repository URL in the command-line arguments.
  - Extracts the repository name from the URL.
  - Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
  - Initializes services for interacting with Azure OpenAI, GitHub, and Java parsing.
  - Clones the specified repository and identifies all Java files within it.
  - Parses the Java files to extract class-level documentation.
  - Generates various documentation artifacts, including a project overview, class-level documentation, a getting-started guide, and FAQs.
  - Outputs the generated documentation to a `docs` directory and provides the user with the location of the generated files.

### `private static String extractRepositoryName(String repoUrl)`
- **Description**: Extracts the repository name from a given GitHub URL. The repository name is returned in the format `username/repo`.
- **Parameters**:
  - `String repoUrl`: The GitHub repository URL.
- **Return Value**: 
  - `String`: The extracted repository name in the format `username/repo`. If the URL format is unrecognized, a fallback mechanism is used to extract the last part of the URL.
- **Exceptions**: None explicitly thrown, but the method assumes the input is a valid URL string.
- **Usage Example**:
  ```java
  String repoUrl = "https://github.com/username/repo.git";
  String repoName = repodocaiagentApplication.extractRepositoryName(repoUrl);
  System.out.println(repoName); // Output: username/repo
  ```
- **Details**:
  - Uses a regular expression to handle various GitHub URL formats, including HTTPS and SSH.
  - If the URL ends with `.git`, the suffix is removed.
  - Falls back to extracting the last part of the URL if the regular expression does not match.

## Usage Patterns and Best Practices
1. **Running the Application**:
   - Ensure that the `.env` file is present in the working directory with the required environment variables for Azure OpenAI and GitHub services.
   - Execute the application with a valid GitHub repository URL as the first command-line argument.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     java -jar java-documentation-agent.jar https://github.com/username/repo.git
     ```

2. **Error Handling**:
   - The application logs errors and terminates with a non-zero exit code in case of invalid input or runtime exceptions. Ensure that the input URL is valid and accessible.

3. **Generated Documentation**:
   - The generated documentation is stored in the `docs` directory. Review the console output for the exact location and access URLs.

## Notes
- This class is designed to be executed as a standalone application and is not intended to be instantiated or extended.
- Ensure that all dependencies, including the `.env` file and required services, are properly configured before running the application.
