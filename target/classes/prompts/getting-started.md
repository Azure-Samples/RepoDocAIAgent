# Task
Create a practical Getting Started guide based on actual analysis of a Java repository.

# Repository Analysis
Repository Name: {{repositoryName}}
Main Classes: {{mainClasses}}
Public API Classes: {{publicClasses}}
Package Structure: {{packageStructure}}
Dependency Information: {{dependencies}}

# Key Classes Analysis
{{classAnalysis}}

# Entry Points and Examples
{{entryPointAnalysis}}

# Instructions
1. **Analyze the repository structure** to understand how developers would actually use this project
2. **Identify the main entry points** (classes with main methods, public APIs, etc.)
3. **Create a practical getting started guide** with these sections:
   - Prerequisites (based on code dependencies)
   - Installation instructions
   - Quick start tutorial with real examples
   - Basic usage patterns
   - Common use cases
   - Next steps and advanced features

4. **Requirements for examples**:
   - Use ACTUAL class names and method names from the repository
   - Create working code examples that would compile
   - Show realistic usage scenarios
   - Include necessary imports and setup code
   - Progress from simple to more complex examples

5. **Structure the guide progressively**:
   - Start with the simplest possible example
   - Build up to more complex scenarios
   - Show different ways to use the API
   - Include common configuration options

6. **Writing style**:
   - Tutorial format with step-by-step instructions
   - Practical and actionable
