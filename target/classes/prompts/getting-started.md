# Task
Create a practical Getting Started guide based on actual analysis of a Java repository.

# Repository Analysis
Repository Name: {{repositoryName}}
Main Classes: {{mainClasses}}
Public API Classes: {{publicClasses}}
Package Structure: {{packageStructure}}
Dependency Information: {{dependencies}}

# Key Classes Analysis
{{classAnalysis}}

# Entry Points and Examples
{{entryPointAnalysis}}

# Instructions
1. **Analyze the repository structure** to understand how developers would actually use this project
2. **Identify the main entry points** (classes with main methods, public APIs, etc.)
3. **Create a practical getting started guide** with these sections:
   - Prerequisites (based on code dependencies)
   - Installation instructions
   - Quick start tutorial with real examples
   - Basic usage patterns
   - Common use cases
   - Next steps and advanced features

4. **Requirements for examples**:
   - Use ACTUAL class names and method names from the repository
   - Create working code examples that would compile
   - Show realistic usage scenarios
   - Include necessary imports and setup code
   - Progress from simple to more complex examples

5. **Structure the guide progressively**:
   - Start with the simplest possible example
   - Build up to more complex scenarios
   - Show different ways to use the API
   - Include common configuration options

6. **Writing style**:
   - Tutorial format with step-by-step instructions
   - Practical and actionable
   - Include troubleshooting tips
   - Professional but accessible tone

# Output Format
Provide ONLY the complete Getting Started guide in valid Markdown format. Do not include meta-commentary.
# Output Format
Provide ONLY the complete class documentation in valid Markdown format. Do not include meta-commentary. 
# Output Format
Start your response immediately with the markdown content - no preamble, no code blocks, no explanations.
**CRITICAL**: Do NOT wrap your entire response in ```markdown code blocks. 
Your response should start directly with:
# [Project Title]
And continue with raw markdown content.
Only use code blocks (```) for actual code examples within the documentation, not to wrap the entire response.
